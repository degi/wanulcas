## Balancing pattern and process

A focal point in the analysis of where and how agroforestry systems work
is still whether or not tree-crop systems can utilize resources of
light, water and/or nutrients which would not be used in a simpler tree
or crop system (Cannell *et al.*, 1996). A fair amount of detail in the
description of above- and belowground resource capture by the component
species is needed to evaluate both competition and complementarity
(Sanchez, 1995; Ong and Huxley, 1996).

Tree-soil-crop interactions occur both in space and time. In
\'sequential\' agroforestry systems neighbourhood effects in a landscape
mosaic still have a spatial element, while \'simultaneous\' systems
often have at least an element of zonation. The dichotomy between
sequential and simultaneous agroforestry systems may thus have been
overstated in the past and a modelling framework is desirable in which
they are endpoints of a continuum.

[fig1_1] classification of the way crop growth models deal with spatial and temporal complexity;
agroforestry models should explore the diagonal, rather than try to introduce spatial patterns in complex process based models.

In modelling agroforestry systems, a balance should be maintained
between \'process\' and \'pattern\', between temporal and spatial
aspects (Figure 1.1). Existing crop growth models tend to be detailed in
\'processes\', but they usually do not take spatial patterns into
account. They (implicitly) assume a homogeneous \'minimum
representative\' area, with a one-dimensional variation between soil
layers. Most GIS (geographical information systems) applications do not
incorporate spatial interactions and estimate the total output of an
area as the summation of area times output per unit area, for grid cells
which are not dynamically interacting with their neighbours (similar to
a \'stratified\' sampling approach). For representations of agroforestry
we need both spatial and dynamic aspects, and should therefore aim at
models along the diagonal line in Figure. 1.1. Full-scale detail on
spatial interactions may not be achievable for any reasonable process
description, however, and it may be best to start in the lower left
corner with fairly simple process and spatial descriptions, only to move
to the upper right corner where research questions require more detail.
As a starting point on the spatial side, we have chosen for a system of
\'zoning\', which can relate many types of spatial patterns to a model
still covering essential aspects of real-world behaviour. Spatial
interactions, such as shading aboveground and competition for water and
nutrients belowground may occur over a range of distances. Instead of a
black/white sharp boundary, every tree-crop interface may consist of
several shades of grey in between. The zoning system we opt for appears
to have the minimum complexity to do justice to such interactions.

In simultaneous agroforestry systems, trees and food crops are
interacting in various ways. As both positive and negative interactions
occur, optimization of the system will have to be site specific. The
most important interactions probably are:

1.  Shading by the trees, reducing light intensity at the crop level,

2.  Competition between tree and crop roots for water and/or nutrients
    in the topsoil,

3.  Mulch production from the trees, increasing the supply of N and
    other nutrients to the food crops,

4.  Nitrogen supply by tree roots to crop roots, either due to root
    death following tree pruning or by direct transfer if nodulated
    roots are in close contact with crop roots,

5.  Effects on weeds, pests and diseases,

6.  Long term effects on erosion, soil organic matter content and soil
    compaction.

Interactions 3, 4 and 6 are positive, 1 and 2 are normally negative, and
5 can have both positive and negative elements. The positive and
negative effects can interact during the growing season, and this may
limit the use of end-of-season summaries of the tree-crop interaction
effects. Yet, such summaries are helpful as a first approximation.

## Tree-soil-crop interactions

The success of any intercropping depends on the balance of positive
(facilitation) and negative (competition) interactions between the
components Vandermeer (1989). Ong (1995) and Akeampyong *et al.* (1995)
developed a simple equation for quantifying tree-soil-crop interactions
(I), distinguishing between positive effects of trees on crop growth via
soil fertility improvement (F) and negative effects via competition (C)
for light, water and nutrients. Very much simplified, the interaction
term is positive and the combined system may make sense if F \> C, and
not if F \< C.

Cannell *et al.* (1996) attempted to clarify the resource base of the
production by both the crop and the tree. Part of the \'fertility\'
effect of the tree is based on light, water and nutrient resources which
the tree acquired in competition with the crop (F<sub>comp</sub>); another part
may have been obtained in complement to resources available for the crop
(F<sub>noncomp</sub>). Similarly, part of the resources acquired by the tree in
competition with the crop is recycled within the system and may thus be
used by a future crop (C<sub>recycl</sub>). Tree products that are not recycled
may have direct value for the farmer (C<sub>nonrecycl</sub>).

One may argue that F<sub>comp</sub> is based on the same resources as C<sub>recycl</sub>
and that in the longer run the two terms would cancel. The question
whether or not a tree-crop combination gives yield benefits then depends
on:

1.  the complementarity of the resource use,

2.  the value of direct tree products, specifically those obtained in
    competition, C<sub>nonrecycl</sub>, relative to the value of crop products
    that could have been produced with these resources.

3.  the efficiency of recycling tree resources into crop products,
    specifically for the resources obtained in competition with the
    crop, C<sub>recycl</sub>.

**Table 1.1.** Three-step approach to analysis and synthesis of tree-soil-crop interactions in simultaneous agroforestry systems. A direct experimental separation of the terms in the equation is combined with quantification of key processes and followed by model synthesis to explore management options and system-site matching (van Noordwijk *et al.*, 1998a).

Apart from yield effects of agroforestry, labour requirements have a
strong impact on profitability, and for this one should compare
additional labour use (eg. tree pruning) and labour saving aspects (eg.
weed control). Complementarity of resource use can be based on a
difference in timing of tree and crop resource demand. If the tree picks
up the \'left overs\' from the cropping period, as occurs with water in
the *Grevillea* maize systems in Kenya (Ong; *pers. comm.*) and
transforms these resources into valuable products, a considerable degree
of competition during the temporal overlap may be acceptable to the
farmer. If tree products have no direct value, agroforestry systems may
only be justified if F<sub>noncomp</sub> \> C<sub>nonrecycl</sub>. With increasing direct
value of the tree products, the requirements for complementarity
decrease.

The efficiency of recycling will depend on the degree of synchrony
between mineralization from these organic residues and crop nutrient
demand, as well as on the residence time of mineral nutrients in the
crop root zone under the site-specific climate and soil conditions (De
Willigen and Van Noordwijk, 1989; Myers *et al.*, 1994, 1997).

As light is not stored in ecosystems, complementarity in light use is
easy to measure. For water and nutrients complementarity has to consider
time scales linked to the \'residence\' times of the resources in the
ecosystem; residence times tend to increase from water, via nitrogen and
potassium to phosphorus. For P resources used by the tree it will be
difficult to measure whether or not this P might have become available
to the crop in the absence of trees. Indications of complementarity in
belowground resource use can be obtained by observing the root
distribution of both components. Actual uptake of resources will,
however, depend on resource and root distribution as well as demand
factors, and thus the degree of overlap in root distribution *per se* is
not sufficient to predict competition.

Van Noordwijk (1996a) presented explicit algebraic solutions for an
agroforestry model which links both the mulch production and its ensuing
soil fertility effect and the shading which is assumed to have a
negative effect on crop yields to the biomass production of the tree.
The model leads to a simple mulch/shade ratio as a basis for comparing
tree species. The model also predicts that at low soil fertility, where
the soil fertility improvement due to mulch can be pronounced, there is
more chance that an agroforestry system improves crop yields than at
higher fertility where the negative effects of shading will dominate.
The mulch/shade model, however, does not incorporate the interactions
between water availability, N dynamics, crop and tree growth.
Incorporating these elements on the basis of a daily time step extends
the model beyond what can be solved explicitly and into the realm of
dynamic simulation models, which keep track of resource stocks outside
and inside the plants and use these to calculate daily resource flows
and daily resource capture.

The tree-soil-crop interaction equation can be further analyzed by
differentiating between short and long term fertility effects (F<sub>1</sub> and
F<sub>ω</sub>, respectively) and by separating the competition term in an above-
and a belowground component (C<sub>l</sub> and C<sub>n+w</sub>, respectively). Van
Noordwijk *et al.* (1998a) described a three-step approach to link these
overall terms to experimental treatments, process research and WaNuLCAS
as a synthesis model (Table 1.1). The total balance for belowground
resources (water or nutrients) inputs into an agroforestry system is:

$$\Delta Stored = Input + Recycle - {Upt}_{crop} - {Upt}_{tree,comp} - {Upt}_{tree,noncomp} - Loss$$

The term Upt<sub>tree,noncompetitive</sub> represents the safetynet function of
tree roots for nutrients and water leaching and percolating below the
zone of crop roots and/or outside of the crop growing season (Van
Noordwijk *et al.*, 1996*)*, as well as a nutrient pump role for
resources stored in the subsoil for longer periods of time (Young,
1997).

In summary, we argue that agroforestry systems do not make much sense
from a biophysical point of view, unless there is at least some
complementarity in resource capture. Direct empirical approaches to
quantify complementarity are possible for aboveground processes, but
more complex belowground, as resources there are stored over a longer
period of time, making it more difficult to judge whether or not
resources could have been used outside an agroforestry context. Models
of tree-soil-crop interactions have to pay specific attention to the
depth from which each component is capturing water and nutrients on a
daily basis, in order to derive overall complementarity on a seasonal
basis.

## Intercropping, crop-weed and agroforestry models

Attempts to link separately developed crop models into an
\'intercropping\' model have not been very successful yet (Caldwell *et
al.*, 1996). A possible reason for this is that accurate description of
both above- and below ground resource capture is more critical in a
competitive situation than in a monoculture. Aboveground canopy
structure does not matter in a monoculture as long as total LAI is
predicted correctly. A coarse approximation of the allocation of current
uptake of water and nutrients from the soil profile can be good enough,
if the resources not used today still remain in the soil on the next
day. In a competitive situation, however, it matters where the leaves of
each component are relative to those of other components; belowground
resources not utilized today may have been taken up by other components
before tomorrow. It thus appears that a reasonable performance of a crop
growth model in a monoculture situation is a necessary condition for
expecting it to perform in intercropping, but not a sufficient
condition. Additional detail may be needed to get above- and belowground
resource capture correct.

Kropff and Van Laar (1993) gave an overview of models for crop-weed
interactions: such models tend to emphasize the phenology of the species
competing for resources, as they are meant to help in predicting the
effect of interventions (weeding) at different points in the crop life
cycle. Otherwise, crop-weed models differ only in name from
intercropping models, as both describe resource capture in a system
where at least two plants are interacting.

In intercropping models, however, both components have direct value to
the farmer, whereas in crop-weed systems the 'weeds' have no direct
value at all (although they may help in conserving nutrients in the
system and reducing losses by leaching). Agroforestry models have to
include a two-plant interaction (Figure. 1.2), similar to intercropping
and crop-weed models, but differ in that one of the plants is a
perennial species. Part of the inspiration for an agroforestry model may
thus come from existing tree or forest models.

Rather than linking existing tree and crop models, an alternative
approach is to develop a generic plant-plant interaction model. The
focus should be on above- and belowground resource capture and its
interplay (Figure. 1.3). Specific parameters for each component can be
derived from more specialized component models, such as drivers for
physiological development (onset of flowering, internal redistribution
in generative stage). The model should, however, give a fair description
of \'architecture\' (spatial distribution of the relevant organs) above-
and belowground and their consequences for uptake. A correct account of
the spatial distribution of organs for resource capture is probably more
important in plant-plant interaction models than it is in models for
monocultural stands.

**Figure 1.2.** Components of the WaNuLCAS model.

**Figure 1.3.** Resource capture framework for modeling plant growth, based on shoot and root biomass, allocation to leaf and root area index (LAI and RAI, respectively) and its spatial distribution (based on \'architecture\') and capture of light, water and nutrients; aboveground plant-plant interactions modify resource flow, belowground they modify stocks.

A major problem in linking a number of single-species resource capture
models into a multi-species resource capture model with a single
accounting systems for the resources, is one of priority assignment in
the calculation sequence. Models which consistently assign priority to
one of the components may vastly overestimate its resource capture,
while the solution of some models of alternating priorities is not very
satisfactory either (Caldwell *et al.*, 1996).

For a more balanced approach, the resource capture of the various
components should be further integrated and applied simultaneously,
avoiding priority assignment. One way of doing this is adding the root
(for water and nutrients) and leaves in a common layer or zone,
calculating a total resource capture and sharing this out over the two
(or more) components in proportion to their root length density or leaf
area. As resource capture is in most cases a non-linear function of root
length or leaf area, this approach to resource sharing gives a different
result from adding resource capture for the two components (the latter
may overestimate potential uptake rates).

## Objectives of the WaNuLCAS Model

In developing a generic model for water, nutrient and light capture in
agroforestry systems (WaNuLCAS), we aimed at a model which would:

1.  integrate knowledge and hypotheses on below‑ and aboveground
    resource capture by trees and crops (or any two (or more) types of
    plants) **at patch scale** (the smallest 'self-contained' unit for
    describing the tree/crop interaction) as a basis for predicting
    complementarity and competition,

2.  build on **well-established modules** (models) of a soil water,
    organic matter and nitrogen balance, and crop and a tree development
    to investigate interactions in resource capture,

3.  describe the **plant-plant interaction** term as the outcome of
    **resource capture** efforts by the component species, as determined
    by their above- and belowground architecture (spatial organization)
    as well as physiology,

4.  be applicable to spatially zoned **agroforestry systems** as well as
    rotational systems,

5.  avoid where possible the use of parameters which can only be derived
    by fitting the model to empirical data sets and maximize the use of
    parameters which can be **independently measured**

6.  be flexible in exploring **management options** within each type of
    agroforestry system,

7.  be useful in estimating **extrapolation domains** for \'proven\'
    agroforestry techniques, as regards **soil and climate** properties,
    as well as tree and crop architecture,

8.  **be user-friendly** and allow \'non-modelers\' to explore a range
    of options, while remaining open to improvement without requiring a
    complete overhaul of the model,

9.  generate **output** which can be used in existing spreadsheets and
    graphical software,

10. make use of readily available and tested modeling software.

In view of objectives 8, 9 and 10 we chose the Stella Research modeling
shell (Hannon and Ruth, 1994) linked to Excel spreadsheets for data
input and output. The current model should be seen as a prototype; in
the Stella environment it is relatively easy to modify or add modules or
relationships.

Models can be of value (\'validated\' in the original sense of the word)
if a) they adequately reflect the major assumptions one would like to
make about component processes, if b) they operate smoothly in the
parameter range where one would like to use them, and/or if c) their
quantitative predictions agree with measured results in specific
experiments (Van Noordwijk, 1996b). Before model validation is
undertaken, (1) the purpose of the model, (2) the performance criteria
and (3) the model context must be specified (Rykiel, 1996). At this
stage we have concentrated on levels a and b of the validation process.
WaNuLCAS model is meant as a prototype model, not including all possible
tree-soil-crop interaction relationships that one can imagine, but
incorporating a core of relations which we are fairly sure of for each
specific case. In this sense the model can be viewed as a \'null model\'
(Gotelli and Graves, 1996) which can be used like a null hypothesis as a
background against which specific data sets can be tested. The open
modeling frame will allow users to add other relationships when and
where they wish. Muetzelfeldt and Taylor (1997) have translated WaNuLCAS
into a new modelling platform Agroforestry Modeling Environment (AME) as
a platform. This modelling environment is now called SIMILE and is
currently used in developing FLORES model. The European sylvo-arable
agroforestry project SAFE is developing a model with greater spatial
articulation HiSAFE.
