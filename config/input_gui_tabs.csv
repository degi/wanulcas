The 'effectiveness' parameter specified here is multiplied with the product of the root length densities (in layer 1 and 2) of the host and the parasite to derive the fraction of roots that is parasitized (in all soil layers) and effectively belongs to (contributes to water and nutrient uptake) of the parasite in stead of the host."
