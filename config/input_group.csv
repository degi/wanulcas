6,"Trees,crops & weed as hosts for T1","An option is provided for simulating root parasitism by Tree 1 on roots of Tree2, Tree3 or any of the crop (or weed) types. The 'effectiveness' parameter specified here is multiplied with the product of the root length densities (in layer 1 and 2) of the host and the parasite to derive the fraction of roots that is parasitized (in all soil layers) and effectively belongs to (contributes to water and nutrient uptake) of the parasite in stead of the host."
